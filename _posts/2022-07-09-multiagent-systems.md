Multi-agent systems  are a new and promising area in the field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI), as well as in the mainstream computer science. These systems are compound of relatively autonomous and intelligent parts, called agents. Even if we restrict ourselves to computer science, a word ‘agent’ has many meanings. Agent is defined as: “… a hardware or (more usually) software based computer system that enjoys the following properties:

* autonomy: agents operate without the direct intervention of humans or others, and have some kind of control over their actions and internal state;

* social ability: agents interact with other agents (and possibly humans) via some kind of agent-communication language;

* reactivity: agents perceive their environment (which may be the physical world, a user via a graphical user interface, a collection of other agents, the Internet, or perhaps all of these combined), and respond in a timely fashion to changes that occur in it;

* pro-activeness: agents do not simply act in response to their environment, they are able to exhibit goal-directed behavior by taking the initiative.”

This definition does not specify the size of agents. They can be as big as expert system and as small as the part of an application interface. Agent can be static (permanently located in some computer) or mobile (moving across the computer network, such as Internet). The amount of agent intelligence is also not specified.

Agent-oriented programming languages are programming languages developed for programming of agents. Agent-oriented programming (AOP) can also be seen as a post-object-oriented paradigm.

An advantage of the usage of agents in software development instead of objects stems from the primitives used for programming. AOP introduces new concepts such as mental categories, reactivity, pro-activeness, concurrent execution inside and between agents, communication, meta-level reasoning, etc.
